See thecopyright tab in the RB, the `notice` property of this package or the`LICENSE` file on GitHub.SuffixConditionals' primary home is the [Cincom Public Store Repository](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/CincomSmalltalkWiki/Public+Store+Repository).Check there for the latest version.  It is also on[GitHub](https://github.com/randycoulman/SuffixConditionals).SuffixConditionals was developed in VW 7.9.1, but is compatible withany version of VisualworksSmalltalk. If you find any incompatibilities,let me know (see below for contact information) or file an issue onGitHub.# IntroductionSuffixConditionals adds `if:` and `unless:` methods to `BlockClosure`in Visualworks Smalltalk.When writing a conditional expression with a single branch (i.e.,`ifTrue:` or `ifFalse:`), it is sometimes desirable for the main focusof the expression to be on the action, rather than the condition.  Inthose cases, the action should come first.  SuffixConditionals makesthat possible.For example, the following code:```(self respondsTo: methodName)    ifTrue: [^self perform: methodName with: anEvent]```can be written as:```[^self perform: methodName with: anEvent]    if: (self respondsTo: methodName)```It is up to you to decide which form is more readable in your code,but SuffixConditionals gives you the choice.# ContributingI'm happy to receive bug fixes and improvements to this package.  Ifyou'd like to contribute, please publish your changes as a "branch"(non-integer) version in the Public Store Repository and contact me asoutlined below to let me know.  I will consider merging your changesback into the "trunk" as soon as I can review them.# Contact InformationIf you have any questions about SuffixConditionals and how to use it, feelfree to contact me.* Web site: http://randycoulman.com* Blog: Courageous Software (http://randycoulman.com/blog)* E-mail: randy _at_ randycoulman _dot_ com* Twitter: @randycoulman* GitHub: randycoulmanDbIdentifier: /Users/randy/repositories/store/RCSmalltalkDbTrace: 1671DbUsername: randyDbVersion: 1DevelopmentPrerequisites: #(#(#any 'Base VisualWorks' ''))PackageName: SuffixConditionalsParcel: #('SuffixConditionals')PrerequisiteDescriptions: #(#(#name 'Base VisualWorks' #componentType #bundle))PrerequisiteParcels: #(#('Base VisualWorks' ''))PrintStringCache: (1,randy)Version: 1Date: 8:10:02 AM April 17, 2014 --><time-stamp>From VisualWorksÂ® Personal Use Edition, 7.9.1 of October 18, 2012 on April 17, 2014 at 8:10:02 AM</time-stamp><do-it>(Dialog confirm: 'You are filing-in a Parcel source file!\\While this is possible it will not have\the same effect as loading the parcel.\None of the Parcel''s prerequisites will\be loaded and none of its load actions\will be performed.\\Are you sure you want to file-in?' withCRs) ifFalse: [self error: 'Parcel file-in abandoned.
